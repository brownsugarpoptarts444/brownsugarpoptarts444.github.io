This is my first time using Python ever. Being introduced to it in this class allowed me the first opportunity to get a feeling for what my friends majoring in CS get to do! 


One of the first things we learned about was a way to make R and Python interact with eachother, using the reticulate package.


First, we load the reticulate package and write our first message in R. 

```{r}
library(reticulate)

first <- "Harry Styles"
```

Then, we can put our next message in a Python code chunk and print it out! We see that we get the full message "Harry Styles in Dallas!"

```{python}
second = "in Dallas!"
print(r.first, second)
```


And we're not limited to seeing the full message in Python. With some modifications we can see the full message using a R code chunk too!

```{r}
cat(c(first, py$second))
```


Now that we can see the message, here is Harry Styles is Dallas!
